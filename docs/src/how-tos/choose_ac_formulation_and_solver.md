# [How to choose an AC formulation and solver](@id choose-ac-formulation-and-solver)

```@meta
CurrentModule = PowerFlows
```

AC power flow has two independent choices: the **formulation** (how the
network equations are written) and the **solver** (the iterative algorithm).
Each is a type parameter: [`ACPolarPowerFlow`](@ref)`{S}` (power balance, polar state),
[`ACRectangularPowerFlow`](@ref)`{S}` (Da Costa current injection), and
[`ACMixedPowerFlow`](@ref)`{S}` (mixed current/power balance, the most compact
state) — each combined with [`NewtonRaphsonACPowerFlow`](@ref) (`NR`),
[`TrustRegionACPowerFlow`](@ref) (`TR`), or
[`LevenbergMarquardtACPowerFlow`](@ref) (`LM`). [`ACPowerFlow`](@ref)`()` is
`ACPolarPowerFlow{NewtonRaphsonACPowerFlow}` — a good default.

For the conceptual split between evaluation models and solvers, see
[Evaluation Models vs. Solver Algorithms](@ref).

Warm-solve timings: median of 10 runs after warm-up, with the `[min, max]`
range. Hardware-dependent — compare medians across cells, not absolutes.

All nine combinations converge to the same solution. On small systems the
differences are negligible (every combination solves a 14-bus case in
2–3 iterations in well under 1 ms median); the choice matters at scale.
The wide LM ranges reflect its per-iteration refactorization variance — the
median is the representative figure.

## Recommendations (based on the median)

  - **Default / general use:** [`ACPowerFlow`](@ref)`()` (Polar + NR). Well-trodden and
    the reference all other formulations are validated against.
  - **Fastest at scale:** [`ACRectangularPowerFlow`](@ref)`{NewtonRaphsonACPowerFlow}`
    or `{TrustRegionACPowerFlow}`. The rectangular formulation's off-diagonal
    Jacobian blocks are the constant admittance matrix, so the sparse
    factorization is reused across iterations — consistently ~15% faster than
    Polar/NR by median (2000 and 10k bus alike); [`ACMixedPowerFlow`](@ref) with NR/TR
    is within a few percent of it.
  - **Most robust (poor start, ill-conditioned, high-impedance):**
    [`TrustRegionACPowerFlow`](@ref) on any formulation — its median is on par
    with NR at every size while globalizing the step. For cases that still will
    not converge, [`RobustHomotopyPowerFlow`](@ref) (Polar only).
  - **Smallest state / most predictable:** [`ACMixedPowerFlow`](@ref) — `2n`
    unknowns, the most compact of the three, and the tightest timing spread at
    every scale (Mixed/NR 10k `[0.182, 0.209]`).
  - **Levenberg-Marquardt:** a robust least-squares fallback, the slowest per
    iteration (it refactorizes a sparse augmented system every step) and the
    highest variance — prefer NR/TR and reach for LM only when they stall. If
    you need LM, use **Mixed/LM** (the only LM that scales: 3–5 iterations and
    the lowest LM median at every size) or Polar/LM. **Avoid Rectangular/LM at
    scale**: its Marquardt scaling helps at ≤2000 buses (7 iters) but does not
    scale — 56 iterations / 4.3 s at 10k, ~20× Rectangular/NR. See
    [Levenberg-Marquardt in Place of Gauss-Seidel](@ref).
  - **Repeated / many solves (PCM, contingency screening, dynamic-sim init):**
    [`FastDecoupledACPowerFlow`](@ref) — the fast decoupled power flow (PSS/E `FDNS`). It is a
    *solver* usable on any formulation (polar uses the classic B′/B″ half-iterations; rectangular
    and mixed use a frozen-Jacobian variant). It is deliberately absent from the iteration tables
    above: it converges at a **linear** rate (many, far cheaper iterations) rather than NR's
    quadratic rate, so an iteration-count comparison is apples-to-oranges. Its constant B′/B″ are
    factored **once** and reused across iterations *and* time steps, so its edge is repeated /
    multi-period solves where that fixed-matrix build amortizes; it is also a cheap initializer
    that can `handoff_solver` to NR/TR/LM for the final polish. For a single one-off solve, NR/TR
    are usually faster. Measure on your system with `test/performance/fd_benchmark.jl`.
