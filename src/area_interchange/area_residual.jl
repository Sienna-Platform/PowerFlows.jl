    _tie_admittances(tie, ybus_nzval) -> (g11, b11, g12, b12, g21, b21, g22, b22)

Read `tie`'s corridor admittances from the aggregate Y-bus 2×2 block through
`tie.nz_offsets` (never cached — a controlled tap mutates `ybus_nzval` in place, so this must
be re-read every evaluation). Off-diagonal reads (`o[2]`/`o[3]`) are the corridor's own
mutual admittance already (only corridor members contribute there) and are used as-is. The
DIAGONAL reads (`o[1]`/`o[4]`) are NOT the corridor's own self-admittance: a nodal Y-bus
diagonal sums every branch/shunt incident at that bus. `tie.diag_pollution` is the
enrollment-time-cached `(ybus_diag − Σ_corridor_members y11/y22)` correction subtracted here
to recover the corridor's own self-term — see `AreaTie`'s docstring for the derivation.

Shared, concrete (`NTuple{8, Float64}`), non-allocating so both the residual kernel
(`_tie_metered_active_power`) and the Jacobian partials
(`_tie_metered_active_power_partials`, `area_jacobian.jl`) always differentiate the exact
same values — the corrected DIAGONAL read must never be duplicated between the two.

`data.area_interchange`/`data.power_network_matrix` IDENTITY, never on its CONTENTS, so a

option, since `PowerFlowData` is immutable and `data.area_interchange` itself can't be

new (smaller) size with each survivor's row carried over from its OLD `tail_ix`, for every

de-enrollment that only THIS time step's relax loop decided on).

Mutates `data.area_interchange`'s FIELDS in place (`PowerFlowData` is immutable, so the
